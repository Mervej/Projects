Traffic and space req -  

assuming 200:1 read/write ratio
-no of url gen in 1 month = 100 * 10^6
-per sec = (100 * 10^6)/(3600*24*30) = 40 
40*200:40 read/write ratio per sec

Storage - 
Assuming lifetime - 100 years & size of url(row record) - 500 bytes
- records = (100*12) * (100 * 10^6)
- total size = (100*12) * (100 * 10^6) * 500 = 50TB

Caching - 
80:20 (80% req are for 20% of the data)
read req per day -> 8000 * 86400 = ~700 mil
to cache 20% = .2 * 700*10^6 * 500 = 70 gb
